This is a personal project to help me study vocabulary words for the GRE

Note that if you would like to use this program you will need to supply your own Merriam-Webster API key Here: http://www.dictionaryapi.com/
Once you get the keys make sure the first line of your Key file is your (collegiate) Dictionary Key and the second line is your Thesaurus Key
Name the file "Keys" with no extension

This program is completely free to use/fork. I do not own Merriam-Webster, it's API, or any of its intellectual property.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions or concerns.
